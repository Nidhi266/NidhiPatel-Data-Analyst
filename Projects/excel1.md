Tools/Technologies Used:
•	Excel: 
•  Used for data cleaning by organizing raw data and ensuring consistency.
•  Applied pivot tables to summarize sales data, identify trends, and aggregate data.
•  Created pivot charts to visually represent key metrics, such as total sales, sales by region, and product performance.
• Utilized slicers to enable easy filtering of data by region (Astoria, Hell’s kitchen, Lower Manhattan)

Key Features:
•	Sales Overview: Displays total sales, growth over time, and top-performing products.
•	Trend Analysis: Visualizes sales trends by time (daily, weekly, hourly, monthly).
•	Regional Sales Breakdown: Geographic insights showing how different locations perform.
•	Product: Breaks down sales by various poducts.
5. Challenges & Solutions:
•	Data Inconsistencies: Some sales records lacked region or product data.
o	Solution: Cleaned the data in Excel using pivot tables and slicers to ensure consistency.
Dataset
 







For exploratory data I considered following questions:	

Prepared the data for analysis
explore the coffee shop dataset, conduct some basic data QA and profiling, and add calculated date and time fields to prepare the data for analysis.
How many transactions were recorded, over what period of time? What products and product categories were sold? Calculate Revenue (price * quantity)
calculate Month and Day of Week based on the transaction date as text (ie “Jan”, “Feb”, “Sun”, “Mon”) calculate extract Hour from the transaction time


 
to slice and dice the coffee shop data with Excel PivotTables, and create views to analyze time series and product-level trends.
Insert a PivotTable on a new tab to show revenue by month
Add two more PivotTables (on the same sheet) to show the number of transactions by day of week and by hour of day
 Add Pivot Charts to show revenue by month as a line chart, transactions by day of week and hour of day as column charts, and transactions by product category as a bar chart




 

 


to show the number of transactions by product category, sorted descending by transactions
 
to show the number of transactions and revenue by product type, sorted descending and filtered to the Top 15 (by transactions)
 

dynamic dashboard 
to visualize the data with Pivot Charts, design an interactive dashboard, and identify insights and recommendations for the coffee shop.
Assemble the charts into a rough dashboard layout, and include space for the PivotTable showing Top 15 product types (you can design your own layout, or follow the solution)

Add a slicer for store location, and connect it to all of the PivotTables on the sheet

Adjust formatting, alignment and polish to finalize the dashboard (TIP: hide the raw PivotTables and remove the worksheet gridlines)
